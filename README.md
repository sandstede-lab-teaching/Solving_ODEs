# Jupyter Notebooks for solving ODEs
This repository contains the following Jupyter notebooks written in Python:

* Create_Direction_Fields: solves user-defined scalar non-autonomous ODEs interactively (mouse clicks define initial conditions);
* Solve_Scalar_ODEs: solves user-defined scalar autonomous ODEs interactively (mouse clicks define initial conditions);
* Create_Phase_Portraits: solves user-defined planar autonomous ODEs interactively (mouse clicks define initial conditions);
* Explore_Numerical_Methods: illustrates the accuracy of several numerical methods and explores their order.

These notebooks require ipywidgets, math, matplotlib, numpy, and scipy.
