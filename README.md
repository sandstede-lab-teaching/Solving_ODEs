# Jupyter Notebooks for solving ODEs
This repository contains the following Jupyter notebooks written in Python:

* **Create Direction Fields:** solves user-defined scalar non-autonomous ODEs interactively (mouse clicks define initial conditions);
* **Solve Scalar ODEs:** solves user-defined scalar autonomous ODEs interactively (mouse clicks define initial conditions);
* **Create Phase Portraits:** solves user-defined planar autonomous ODEs interactively (mouse clicks define initial conditions);
* **Explore Numerical Methods:** illustrates the accuracy of several numerical methods and explores their order.

If you would like to run these notebooks in your webbrowser using Binder, click on the badge below. It may take time for Binder to start, and the notebooks may also run significantly slower than when ran locally.

Alternatively, install a JupyterLab with a Python 3 kernel locally using, for instance, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)). If the command `%matplotlib widget` results in an error, replace it with `%matplotlib notebook`.
